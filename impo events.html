                <h1>The Fall of the Eldar was a catastrophic event in Warhammer 40K’s ancient history, marking the downfall of the Eldar Empire and the birth of Slaanesh, the Chaos God of Excess. Once the dominant race of the galaxy, the Eldar became increasingly hedonistic and corrupt, indulging in excesses that gradually tore at the fabric of reality. Their unchecked depravity led to the formation of a massive Warp storm and, ultimately, the birth of Slaanesh around M25–M30. The psychic shockwave from its creation annihilated most of the Eldar race, destroyed their gods, and created the Eye of Terror, a massive Warp rift at the heart of their former empire.</h1>
